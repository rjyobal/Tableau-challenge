## Data observations:

Trips by Weekday: We can observed in the analyzed data, there is clear trend on trips increasing during the week, showing the largest recorded trips on Saturdays.

Trip Duration by Weekday: Data show a clear trend on longest trip duration during the weekends, and mid-days shows shorter duration trips thru the observed week.

Peak Hours: Looking at the data analyzed, we can tell peak hours start to raised from 6 to 8am, where people move to work. Then there is a drop for a couple of hours in the morning. Finally, starting lunch hours the numbers of trips increased in the afternoons, and then drop for later hours in the day.

Gender & Age: Using the chart, we can see younger people have the longest trip durations, but data shows this range of age do not ride too much, just a few trips can be observed. In the other hand, we can see people in their mid age making a lot of trips with an average of 10 to 15 minutes. Finally looking at the gender, it is a clear difference on the trips count males do in all age ranges, almost doubling female ride's count.
